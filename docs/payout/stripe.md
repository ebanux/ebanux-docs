# Stripe

Stripe is a platform which provides payment processing software for e-commerce applications. Business owners can use Stripe to accept different payment methods for their products or services.

Stripes software includes a payment processing platform, as well as a credit card payment gateway, and both are required in each successful online transaction, therefore it's regarded as one of the most efficient and simple software to choose for online payments.

### How does Stripe work?

Stripe Payments handles the steps between a customer provides a card information and realizes that the payment was accepted.

Those steps, in general terms, are:

- First, the customer provides the card information.

- The card details enter Stripe’s payment gateway, which encodes the information.

- Stripe sends that information to the acquirer, a bank that will process the transaction on behalf of the merchant. In this step, Stripe acts as the merchant (with the business owner as a sub-merchant). This means Stripe users don’t have to set up a merchant account, which can be difficult.

- The payment passes through a credit card network, like Visa or Mastercard, to the cardholder’s issuing bank.

- The issuing bank approves or denies the transaction.

- That signal travels from the issuing bank through the card network to the acquirer, then through the gateway to the customer — who sees a message that notifies the payment has been accepted or declined.

Once the cardholder’s issuing bank finalizes its approval, you can transfer funds from Stripe into your business bank account. Stripe customers can receive payouts when transactions have finished processing (usually around two business days). Payouts can also be made on a schedule of your choosing (daily, weekly or monthly).

You’ll pay Stripe for facilitating each transaction. These fees vary by transaction type; for example, each successful online payment costs 2.9% plus 30 cents
