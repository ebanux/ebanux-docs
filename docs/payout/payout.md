# Payout Settings

Ebanux partners with Stripe to handle KYC obligations and meet requirements for payment compliance. So we recommend to use an Stripe Account when you edit your payout settings. To know more about Stripe you should read: [Stripe](stripe.md)

However, there are some countries where Stripe is not available. When that's the case, you can use a Payoneer Account when you edit your payout settings. To know more about Payoneer you should read: [Payoneer](payoneer.md)
