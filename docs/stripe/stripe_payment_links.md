# Stripe Payment Links

You can accept a payment without building additional standalone websites or applications by using Stripe Payment Links and sharing the link as many times as you want on social media, in emails, or on your website.

To create a link you need to register for a Stripe Account first. 

If you want to create a link for ecommerce or SaaS where you’re selling products for a fixed price, you should follow the steps below

1. In the Dashboard, open the Payment links page.
2. Select **+Add a new product**.
3. Fill out the product details.
4. Click **Add product**.
5. Click **Next**.
6. Click **Create link**.

After creating a link you’ll automatically see the details page where you can click to copy, share, and reuse a single link with your customers multiple times.
