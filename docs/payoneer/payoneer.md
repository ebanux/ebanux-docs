# Payoneer

Payoneer is a payment platform that enables quick, secure, and low-cost international payments.

Payoneer allows merchants to send and receive payments without requiring a merchant account. It is a popular option for freelancers, international businesses and users of e-commerce marketplaces such as Airbnb and Upwork.

### How does Payoneer work?

- Businesses send requests for payment to customers. The customers then can pay online via a bank account or credit card. Payoneer does not let you directly bill customers. Instead, businesses request payment through the platform and wait for the customer to initiate payment.

- The funds then are transfered to a business’s Payoneer account, and the business can deposit the funds into its bank account or use the money via a Payoneer debit card.

- Funds from payments are available instantly; however, it can take between two to five days for funds to reach your bank account once you've requested a withdrawal. Immediate ATM withdrawal is available with the Payoneer Mastercard.

- Payoneer is not a typical merchant account since that it is not a bank and does not hold the funds. Instead, funds transfer directly into the business’s Payoneer account and the business must transfer them to its bank.

- Payoneer integrates directly with a lot of e-commerce marketplaces, including Airbnb, Upwork, Amazon, Walmart, eBay and Fiverr.

- Payoneer's “Make a Payment” function allows businesses to send payments to other Payoneer account holders free of charge. If the other party does not have a Payoneer account, it can create one to receive payment or Payoneer can initiate a bank transfer. But be prepared to pay up to 2% of the transaction in fees along with additional fixed fees for USD, EUR and GBP currencies.
