## Set up the payout method

You can navigate in the different views and go back to the Home view anytime for setting up the payout method; however we recommend to do it prior to any other action in Ebanux. For setting up the payout method, press the button Payout Settings.

At first, you need to select the payout method. We strongly recommend to use Stripe. Nevertheless, if you are in a country where Stripe is not available, you can use Payoneer instead.

Then you will be redirected to Ebanux

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/188725695-1b4bba94-7695-4e94-9b3b-7ada3d6a7bbd.png)

After being redirected to the Ebanux Home view, you will be notified if your Stripe Account was verified or not.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189950108-8eaf51a5-badf-49cb-8307-3c8dc13b9b6b.png)

In the case of the example, the account was not verified. You shouldn't worry about that issue. Sometimes Stripe doesn't ask for the whole information at once, so you will need to complete the information by entering again to the Payout Settings view.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189952840-122ac346-e32a-4e3c-8685-b53f5b33378a.png)

The Payout Settings let you know your Stripe account is not verified. So you need to select Stripe and then press the button Continue.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189956118-7111bf69-cf1d-4149-af99-471d6c15af78.png)

At first you might need to log in with your Stripe credentials

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189959500-cff27b43-18e6-474a-977a-b386bc43dcc4.png)

After entering the verification code

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189959770-06ee3b6c-d749-4b8a-ba8f-cfe597df8fe9.png)

You will enter to a review page like the one below.

In the case of the example, some personal details are missing or mistaken. So you need to edit you personal details. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189963340-1a221d5e-b9b7-4272-9d40-e17637102d50.png)

As the view shows, there is a problem with the social security number, so you need to replace its last four digits, then submit.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189963737-3298a920-6869-48d2-bd02-16687dfb2900.png)

You will need to submit again

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189964956-4d7853bc-aebf-48a3-8002-4d4c8cd1fbfb.png)

And you will be redirected to Ebanux

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189964987-11a3efe6-6803-4b13-a327-dc6e15d1d02d.png)

After these steps, your account might be still not verified and you don't need to worry. Stripe doesn't require all the information at the same time. In the case of our example, the account is not verified yet as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189983298-9a199a51-427a-4165-bb46-c8793c218342.png)

So, we need to reapeat some steps again and after pressing the button Continue, Stripe will guide you through the information you need to verify. For example, in our case, we previously entered the four last digits of the social security number and now Stripe is asking for the entire number as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189984852-c962491f-e0d2-42cb-bd88-a0463a17ec2f.png)

Then you might need to provide a picture of your id card as shown in the request below

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189986131-e9e750fe-5d85-41e4-ac00-344c39c644d3.png)

If no extra information is requested, you will not see the "Pending verification" label in the Personal Details section, so you can press submit and you probably finish the account verification. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189986965-8cba5fbb-c700-4fd2-86ba-f7765a05fba7.png)

After being redirected to Ebanux you can check in the Home view that your acount has been successfully verified.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54523080/189987789-38e9a98f-ca5b-430e-81ca-27b44b1bb798.png)

After your Stripe Account is verified, you are able to create [Products](products.md) and [Payment Links](payment_links.md)
